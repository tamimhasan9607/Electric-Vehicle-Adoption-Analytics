# Electric-Vehicle-Adoption-Analytics
A Business Intelligence project analyzing electric vehicle adoption trends across U.S. counties using Power BI, Tableau, Google Colab, and Microsoft Excel.

The Washington State Department of Licensing (WSDOL) is doing a significant investigation into the core of electric mobility trends, in light of the changing landscape of sustainable transportation. This initiative is more than a reactionary measure to evolving circumstances; rather, it embodies a proactive endeavor aimed at comprehending and leveraging the profound impact of electric vehicles (EVs) within our localities.
In light of global environmental concerns, there has been a significant increase in the need for transportation solutions that prioritize ecological considerations. Within this particular context, it is acknowledged by the Washington State Department of Labour (WSDOL) that it holds a significant position in providing guidance throughout this transition. In pursuit of this objective, we have commenced the "Electric Vehicle Population Trends: Countywise Analytics Report," a substantial undertaking designed to thoroughly analyze and document the extent of electric vehicle (EV) adoption and its consequences in the various counties of Washington State.
